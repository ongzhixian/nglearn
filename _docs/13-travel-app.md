# Can I Fly? Travel Recommendation App

## Target Consumers
	Anyone located in Singapore (Yeah, we don't care about people staying elsewhere)
	Note: 	`Anyone` here can be locals or expats (students, tourists, business, workers); 
			We want to narrowing down the scope of origin of travel to Singapore to reduce app complexity.

## Use cases
	Exploration:    I want to know where can I go (their severity levels, restrictions).
	                I want to know where can I go without doing certain tests.
	Info Seeking:   I want to know retrictions at target country.
